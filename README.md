# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The leadership is concerned about a "silver tsunami," where there is a mass exodus of retiring employees creating a massive amount of job vacancies.We were given a task to solve two assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. SQL queries were created to generate a list of retiring employees by title and a list of employees eligible for mentorship.
